# Assignment 3 - Due end of the semester
- Project teams chosen by Week 6
- Final project submission & demo Week 13

For this assignment you can do a team project with a team of up to 3 people. You can choose your own teams. You can have less than 3 people and you can also do an individual assignment if you prefer. It would be great if you could manage your code through a public git repository. he theme of the assignment is:

"Something beautiful to enjoy while listening to music."

I will need you to make a youtube video demonstrating your assignment and write a document with the following sections:

- What your assignment does
- What the controls are
- How to make it run
- A list of the stuff you are most proud of. This will help me to grade the assignments.
- What each team member did

Your assignment can be a game or just a visual art piece. You can make your assignment respond to whatever music is playing or it can be something inspired by a particular piece of music. I expect you to have to do self directed learning on the project and come up with ideas and code that we haven't done in the class. Check out these assignments for inspiration:

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | The assignment is technically complex with lots of elements responding to or synchronised to sound. Lots of interactivity and things to see and do in the assignment. You have done lots of self directed learning and included many advanced coding techniques that you have taught yourself. The assignment uses input devices to control your assignment such as the Kinect, Leap motion, microphone, webcam, a game controller or a custom controller. Your code is organised into classes that use inheritance and polymorphism. You have used vectors, transforms and physics. The colours you have chosen are harmonious and beautiful. Your team worked well together. You divided up the work equally and each team member made an equal contribution. You demoed your assignment with pride at DubLudo or similar event or performed it at a public event and got feedback. The assignment is well documented with detailed instructions and a youtube video. Your team made or programmed all the art assets to a high standard. You worked on the assignment making steady progress and have documented this. Your creation is an enjoyable experience that really suits the music you are using. |
| 2.1 | The assignment is fairly complex with some elements responding to sound in a straightforward way such as colours changing or shapes changing size. There is a little interactivity. You have added a few features that you have had to learn some programming stuff for. You use a game controller. Your team made or programmed all the art assets but maybe got some stuff online too. Your colours are good but could use some improvement to make them more beautiful. Your team worked well together and your document includes the main features and controls. One or two people on the team did more of the coding, so they get the bulk of the marks. You have used classes, but maybe not inheritance & polymorphism.  |
| 2.2 | The assignment isn't complex and is mostly based on modifying the examples we developed in the class. Your documentation is minimal and little evidence of good project management. Development on the project was rushed and you left everything until the week before the submission deadline. There are are incomplete features or things you planned to get working and couldn't. No youtube video or minimal documentation. |
| Pass | Something very basic that is just a small modification of the code we developed in the class. Missing documentation. Completed in the days before the deadline and minimal or missing documentation. |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| First | Significantly improved on the core gameplay by adding features such as the ability to shoot as asteroids, sound effects, several levels of increasing difficulty, better player movement, animation and explosions (or other cool stuff). Use of advanced features of Processing that we haven't covered in the class. For example, PShape, classes, pushMatrix and popMatrix |
| 2.1 | Used functions, arrays, loops, variables and implemented everything in the video |
| 2.2 | Got the core game implemented but missing some features such as the splash screen or the game over screen. Didn't use functions and instead everything in the draw function |
| Pass | Got some basic stuff like the player and asteroids working but no collisions |
| Fail | Very little works |

# Assignment 1

Create an animated Christmas card in Processing. You must make the Christmas card for someone and give it to that person. 
Here are some examples of previous assignments that students have done:

In your Christmas card you should use:

- Procedural drawing (no sprites!)
- Variables
- The if statement
- Loops
- Functions
- Arrays
- Any other cool stuff you have taught yourself in Processing

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Animation, loops, arrays and methods used extensively and correctly. Everything parameterised. Use of audio and fonts. Some complex interactivity such as a game or generative system. Use of keyboard, mouse or controller input. Music and fonts. Use of some advanced features of P5 we haven't covered in class such as classes and libraries. 200+ lines of code|
| 2.1 | Lots of animation, loops and arrays. Functions. Also using audio and fonts. Little or no interactivity. Between 100 and 200 lines of code |
| 2.2 | No animation or simple back and forth type animation, use of loops, but no arrays. Some duplicated code that could be replaced by an array or a loop. Some methods, but no parameters instead using global variables (or no methods). Around 100 lines of code|
| Pass | No animation. No loops or arrays, just some simple drawing in the draw method, or some attempt at loops that doesn't work. 20-50 lines of code |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |
